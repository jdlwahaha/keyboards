                This keyboard is not built to last, but it is extremely comfortable to type on. The keyboard flexes very badly with light touches. The full back plate is just a sticker and to be honest, I’m not sure how long this solar battery system could last until it dies. Reading through other reviews online, the lifespan of this solar rechargeable cell is about 2 years. CDN$79.99 for 2 year does not sound like a fair deal to me. <br><br>Despite its low quality build, this keyboard has got to be one of the most comfortable keyboards that I have typed on. It is a membrane keyboard, but the feedback from the keypress is so nice and the travel distance between the keys is just right. Having that said, comfortability is the only thing that this keyboard does, but it’s missing a lot more features. <br><br>This keyboard does not have a caps lock indicator for some reason. Personally, I need it for my use case with Macbook Air. I type in Chinese (Zhuyin) and if the caps lock is on, it switches the language to English. It is also important to have caps lock with English input. I found it annoying that I can only find out that my letters are in uppercase after I start typing. It just doesn’t make sense to me why Logitech couldn’t include this indicator with this model. <br><br>Aside from the caps lock, I think it would be better if it had a battery indicator instead of this charging indicator. Charging indicator just helps me know that my solar panel is working which is pretty much useless. I need to know the battery more so when my keyboard dies, I would know if it’s a battery problem, a connection problem, or hardware issue. Battery indication just makes more sense to me. <br><br>I give it a 2-star because it is just so comfortable to type on, but other than that, it is not built to last or for productivity. I also noticed that they removed a few accessories from the box compared to the same model 8 years ago. Overall, I don’t recommend this keyboard. For the price that they are asking here, I think you would be able to get a better option than this one. <br><br>
